Data : is a collection of raw bytes. data is a collection of raw , unorganized facts and details like text , observation
       , figure , symbols and description of things etc 
       in other words , data does not carry any specfic purpose and has no siginficance by itself .
       Data can be recorded and doesn't have any meaning unless processed 
image :  is a collection of bytes
Integer : is a collection of bytes
 byte is a collection of pixels 

	
DB : 	Store the data or persist the data 
MS : set of program 
     -> access -> add -> update -> delete 

Dbms : is a collection of interrelated data and a set of program to access those data . the collection of data 
       usually refered to as the database , contains information relevant to an enterprise . The primary  goal 
       of dbms 	is to provide 	a way to store and retrive database information that is both convienient and 
       efficent .
A DBms is the database itself among with all the software and functionality. It is used to perform different 
operation like addtion ,access,delete,update of data .

// Abstraction : is a process by which we hiding the details from the user and showing only releavant data .
   Tally : is business software gst calculation 

-> view of data (Three Schema Architecture ) : the major purpose of DBMS is to provide users with an abstract view of the data 
                                           . That is the system hides certain details of how the data is stored and maintained . 
   * To simplify user interaction with the system , abstraction is applied through several levels of abstraction 
   * The Main objective of three level architecture is to enable multiple users to access the same data with a personalized view 
     while storing the underlying data only onece .

-> (Three Schema Architecture ) : 
   Schema is design template how it is see : it has physical schema which describes physical storage structure of DB
* physical level / Internal level (how data is stored in the phycial level)
* Logical level / Conceptual level : The concepatual schema describe the design of a database at the conceptual level 	describes 
              what data are stored in Db and what is relationships exist amnong those data.
-> User at logical level does not need to be aware about physical-level structure.
-> DBA , who must decide what information to keep in the DB use the logical level of abstraction.
-> Goal : easy to use 

* View level / External level  : 
-> Highest level of abstraction aims to simplify users interaction with he system by providing 
   differnt view to differnt end-user.
-> Each view schema describes the database paprt that a particular user group is intersted and
   hides the remaining database from  that user group
-> At the extrnal level a database contains several schemas that sometimese called as subschema.
   the subschema is used to describe the differnet view of the database.
-> At view also provide a security mechanism to prevent users from accessing ceratin parts of DB.

  

// Run length encoding  compressing the img 1mb to 50kb



// instace of db means number of rows in the data at the given particular time 
// consistancy strain means that Name not be null 

// DataModels 
* provides a way to describe  the design of db at logical level 
* Underlying the structure of db is the Data Model , a collection of conceptual tool for describing data, data relationships , data semantics & constraints ex er model,relational model 
   , object -oriented model ,etc


// Database Language 

DDL (Data defination Language ) to specify the database schema means that it define student naeme , roll number , and other required details 

DML (Data manipulation Language ) retrival insertion deletion 

// Query language , a part of DML to specify statement requesting the retrieval of information 

// How App access DB? 

// DBMS appication architecture 

 t1 architecute : end user , db server , db 
 t2 architecture : app is particaly into 2 components ,client machine wchich invikoes DB system functionality at server end through query language statement
